## Description
            
This project is a portfolio website built using the [React](https://react.dev/) Javascript library and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

I created this application to showcase my skills and provide a way for others to contact me.

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of building a React application, including how to develop separate components, pages, and utilities, and effectively integrate them.

## Installation

To install this application, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. [Refer to this guide from GitHub if you need help.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository/)

Once cloned, you will need to navigate to the project's folder in your terminal then add the project's dependencies and run the application. 

You can do both by entering the following on one line: `npm i; npx vite`.
